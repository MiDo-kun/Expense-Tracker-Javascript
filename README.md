## Main Objective/s

The main objective of this project was to provide users with a simple and intuitive interface for managing their expenses efficiently. To achieve this objective, the project focuses on implementing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality using JavaScript.

## What I've Learned

Through this project, I gained valuable knowledge and skills in modern web development using JavaScript and related technologies. Specifically, I learned:
