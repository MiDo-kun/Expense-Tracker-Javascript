# Expense Tracker - Javascript 

This project is a blog site web application that focuses on providing visitors with simple yet informative blog posts. The front-end design is minimalist and prioritizes simplicity and ease of use, allowing users to access and read blogs quickly and efficiently. The application was built using Vite, a fast and efficient build tool for modern web development, along with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The Tailwind CSS framework was also used to ensure a streamlined development process.
